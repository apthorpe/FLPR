Set list of source files
Set list of libraries (to exclude)
Set list of subroutine names to exclude

Configuring:
Create global CheckConfigurator containing exclusion patterns/lists and libraries to check against

Scanning:
For all files
  For each subroutine
    If not-empty
      If name-not-excluded by CheckConfigurator
?       If not-internal
1         For each library listed in CheckConfigurator
1           For each pattern in the library
              If match, store tuple of (File, Name, Line, Origin) in LocalSub database
        For each call-stmt in subroutine
          Extract called subroutine name
1           For each library listed in CheckConfigurator
1             For each pattern in the library
                If match, store tuple of (File, ContainingRoutine, Name, Line, Origin) in CalledSub database

Reporting:
Count entries in each db
Get list of unique subs/library
Get list of files containing matches
Dump LocalSub database
Dump CalledSub database
